## Overview

This is a **full-stack personal profile application** built using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React**.

The backend exposes REST APIs to:

- Fetch profile information
- List all projects
- Search projects by skill
- Retrieve top skills
- Perform keyword-based search across profile data

The frontend consumes these APIs and provides a clean UI to display profile details, projects, and search results.
